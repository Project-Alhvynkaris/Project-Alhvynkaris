A short and general description of the following document; what is it and what is it not, in extremely brief summary.

## Initial Heading for First Topic
And the information about it. Do not overuse H2 headings. Write pedantic-ly, with all numbers as numerals, unless it is in a quote.

> *"Quotes within topics follow the same formatting as the initial flair quote, but it is preferable for it to be more relevant and meaningful."*
> Full Capitalized Name, even if mentioned in previous paragraphs or in previous quotes

### Names
To change subtopics, use H3 headings to describe them. When introducing proper nouns attached to people, write the full name with capitalized titles the first time, then just the full name without titles, and additional names beyond first and last (such as middle). First names are considered the first name in the person's full name, last names are considered the second name in the person's full name, lest they have a middle name of which is the 

gah

### Numbers
When typing out numbers, you will type the integer (1, 2, 3), rather than the number (one, two, three), unless acceptable for demonstration. Numbers are however, used in a quote's quote, and for titles, names, etc. However, in those 3, the integer should be used if its intentionally part of one's name or so. For example; King John Doe VI.

### Lists
- End lists with appropriate punctuation.
	- Use tabs.
	- Refrain from long indentation chains.
		- Like so.
			- Please.
				- Do not.
					- Write documents.
						- In this horrible way.
