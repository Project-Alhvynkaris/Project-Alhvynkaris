> *“Always begin with a related quote, for flair, supplementary to the following texts or not.”*
>Full Capitalized Name and/or Capitalized Title or lowercase job, potentially followed by a supplementary action, and no ending punctuation

A short and general description of the following document; what is it and what is it not, in extremely brief summary. Write in US English. The [Linter](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter) plugin should handle some errors, but not all.

## Initial Heading for First Topic
And the information about it. Do not overuse H2 headings. Write with all numbers as numerals, unless it is in a quote. Write pedantically: assume your reader to be of appropriate intellect, capable of basic reasoning, and not a child to be overly guided. If a topic is dependent on other documents for understanding and does not include the relevant info in a previous topic on the same document, ***link the supplementary documents*** instead of assuming assumption, directly to its header if possible.

> *“Quotes within topics follow the same formatting as the initial flair quote, but it is preferable for it to be more relevant and meaningful.”*
>Full Capitalized Name, even if mentioned in previous paragraphs or in previous quotes

### Names
To change subtopics, use H3 headings to describe them. When introducing proper nouns attached to people, write the full name with capitalized titles the first time, then just the full name without titles, and additional names beyond first and last (such as middle). First names are considered the first name in the person’s full name, last names are considered the second name in the person’s full name, lest they have a middle name of which is the 

gah names are hard >:(

### Numbers
When typing out numbers, you will type the integer (1, 2, 3), rather than the number (one, two, three), unless acceptable for demonstration. Numbers are however, used in a quote’s quote, and for titles, names, etc. However, in those 3, the integer should be used if its intentionally part of one’s name or so. For example; King John Doe VI.

### Lists
- End lists with appropriate punctuation.
	- Use tabs.
	- Refrain from long indentation chains.
		- Like so.
			- Please.
				- Do not.
					- Write documents.
						- In this horrible way.
							- I will literallly burn.

### Miscellaneous
General information that isn’t large enough for its own H3.

#### Acceptable Abbreviations
- Misc as in miscellaneous, except in any conlang to English translation wherein you would write out the full *miscellaneous*, lest written in the conlang as a [colexification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colexification) abbreviation.
- Etc as in et cetera, same clause as misc, but writing out the full *et cetera*.
- E.g. as in for example, same clause as misc, but writing out the full *for example*.
- I.e. as in that is, same clause as misc, but writing out the full *that is*.
- Alh as Alhvynkaris (only after possible semantic satiation or if it must be written frequently).
