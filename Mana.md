This document details the energy type of mana, and how it operates as an object in the formation of the mechanic [[Magic]], rather than explaining Magic itself.

## The Power of Mana
Mana is measured in units of aou. 1 aou equates to 1 newton of force, and the metric or [[Aalvakan]] may be applied to it in kiloaou or milliaou as a standard unit, and so forth.

A typical, non-mage can hold around 50-150 aou in their [[Soul]] from passive ambient mana absorption, whilst a professional mage may hold several hundreds kiloaou via tenacity or control; typically a balance of both.

For example, a fireball 1 meter in diameter at 1500K,[^1] burning typical air, for 1 second, would require #NEEDS-MATH

## The Properties of Mana
Mana has numerous, curious properties, of which mostly give it fascinating side effects.

- When accelerated, mana emits electromagnetic waves equivalent to the rate it is accelerated at. It always emits human-visible light.
- In contact with any matter, mana converts into kinetic energy into the matter it comes into contact with.
	- Mana under sufficient mana control will not covert to kinetic energy.
