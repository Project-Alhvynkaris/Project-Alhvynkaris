Hello, and welcome to Project Alhvynkaris; a nonfiction-in-fiction worldbuilding project wherein we do *NOT* break the laws of physics—we only add more and have the characters break it for us.

It gets nerdier every day, and we need your help to patch up our overly complex magic system, to make our map based on simulated tectonic history, culture, [conlangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language), culture based on flora and fauna and more...

###### please help.
