This document details the expression and art of magic. For more detailed information about its fuel, review the [[Mana]] document.

## Runes
All magic is the usage of *runes*; symbols with special meaning to the universe that influence the universe when given mana. There are 6 categories of runes: Definition, Observation, Argumentation, Manifestation, Alteration, Declaration. The former 3 can be referred to as Definitive runes, and the latter 3 can be referred to as Imperative runes.

### Definition Runes
Definition runes store information and can be referred to by other Imperative runes. They are the basis of any spell, being almost always required for safe and predictable casting.[^1] The information they store is exclusively in [[Abstraction]], the magical language conveying concepts such as 'fire' and 'death' and 'math'. The higher [[Magic#A Measure of a Mage|Circle]] the Definition rune is, the more advanced Abstraction it can hold.

There are 3 types of Definition runes: Exact, Limitation, and Objective runes. Limitation runes are the boundaries that the Definitions imply, and Objective runes are the goals that the Definitions imply. Exact runes define the exact Definition like a Limitation and Objective at the same time. The downside of compressing 2 kinds of runes into 1 is that Exact runes are more expensive, but it does increase precision.

Definition precision is a phenomenon that usually isn't a problem in most spells, but in complicated spells requiring precise results, Defining a state with Limitations and Objectives can hide subtle conceptual differences between the two.

Imagine a Limitation rune stating "The object should only be this wet," and an Objective

### Observation Runes
When casting a spell, it can be difficult to change your Definition runes while its being or have been casted. Observation runes solve this issue by Observing things around them.

## A Measure of a Mage
Mages are split into 13 Circles; effectively, their rank. First through Twelfth Circles are *‘normal’*. Thirteenth Circles are called [[Alhvarikos]], the heralds of the [[Alvekai]].

### What is a ‘Circle’?
A Circle is a measurement of a mage’s skill. All runes are sorted into 13 ranked categories, of exponential complexity. If a mage can manifest a Foo-th Circle rune properly, they are considered a Foo-th Circle mage, regardless of their understanding of theory or actual skill beyond mental capacity and capability, as typically, one doesn’t get very far into the Circles without theory. Thus, it is considered a universal method to determine a mage’s power.

For easier comprehension, consider the First Circle to be D&D level 0 spells, Second Circle as level 1 spells, and so on, upto the unobtainable level 12 spells.

#### Circles Listing
Each Circle has a title with it, as a fancier way to express one’s rank.

| Circle | Title      |
| ------ | ---------- |
| 1st    | Vai        |
| 2nd    | Vana       |
| 3rd    | Valua      |
| 4th    | Vanail     |
| 5th    | Kalas      |
| 6th    | Kande      |
| 7th    | Kynaiv     |
| 8th    | Kaevik     |
| 9th    | Kavikan    |
| 10th   | Aklan      |
| 11th   | Aivyka     |
| 12th   | Aalharis   |
| 13th   | Alhvarikos |

A Vai can illuminate their surroundings, while an Aalharis can create what is practically a miniature sun, with sufficient[^2] mana. However, the gap between Alhvarikos and Aalharis is incomparable, as divine runes can be declared to be infinitely more powerful, whilst as simple[^3] as a First Circle rune.

The following depicts notes on each the 13 Circles.
#### Vai
A Vai is the very start of a mage. At this stage, a mage is considered weaker than a trained swordsman in combat, although the cantrips the Vai can cast are very beneficial to any lifestyle. Thus, many who can afford it take a year or two to become a Vai, if only for the convenience.

#### Vana
Often considered the ‘cannon fodder’ of mages, where their power is acceptable yet being sufficiently cheap for armies to train en mass.

#### Valua

#### Vanail

#### Kalas

#### Kande

#### Kynaiv

#### Kaevik
Almost all nobles are at least in the 8th Circle, for personal protection and as proof-of-power.

#### Kavikan

#### Aklan

#### Aivyka

#### Aalharis

##### Alhvarikos
Alhvarikos are infamously blessed with the ability to cast thirteenth circle runes, also known as divine runes. In brief overview, such runes are supremely powerful. They break the laws of physics[^4] as their respective [[Alvekai]] declares. However, each Alhvarikos can only use the Declaration runes gifted from their respective Alvekai, so in theory, a new Alhvarikos could only be as powerful as an Aalharis.

Alas, no Alvekai would leave their Aalharis defenseless, so such an instance lasts only for an instant or so.

[^1]: See *[[Magic#Miscast|miscasting]]*.
[^2]: If a Tenth+ Circle mage ever says ‘sufficient’ mana, they actually mean obscene quantities and are just saying sufficient to sound like the intellectual they aren’t.
[^3]: And thus as trivial to cast, by an Alhvarikos.
[^4]: Note that the laws of magic are considered to be within the laws of physics.
