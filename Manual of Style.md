> *“Always begin with a related quote, for flair, supplementary to the following texts or not.”*
>Full Capitalized Name and/or Capitalized Title or lowercase job, potentially followed by a supplementary action, and no ending punctuation

---

A short and general description of the following document; what is it and what is it not, in a brief (1-3 sentence) summary. Write in US English. The [Linter](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter) plugin should handle some errors, but not all. Write with American English.

## Initial Heading for First Topic
And the information about it. Do not overuse H2. Write with all numbers as numerals, unless it is in a quote. Write akin to the [Wikipedia Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style)'s initial premise: straightforward, succint, in easily understood language[^1]. If a topic is dependent on other documents for understanding and does not include the relevant info in a previous topic on the same document, ***link the supplementary documents*** instead of assuming assumption, directly to its header if possible, preferably a link to the [[Alh Structure Guide|document]] in the sentence[^2].

> *“Quotes within topics follow the same formatting as the initial flair quote, but it is preferable for it to be more relevant and meaningful.”*
>Full Capitalized Name, even if mentioned in previous paragraphs or in previous quotes

### Names
To change subtopics, use H3 to describe them. You don't always need to have a topic sentence(s) at the start of an H3

When introducing proper nouns attached to people, write the full name with capitalized titles the first time, then just the full name without titles, and additional names beyond first and last (such as middle). First names are considered the first name in the person’s full name, last names are considered the second name in the person’s full name, lest they have a middle name of which is the 

gah names are hard >:(

### Numbers
When typing out numbers, you will type the integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3), rather than the word (e.g., one, two, three,) unless acceptable for demonstration. When typing numbers for quotes, names, titles, etc, use the word.

### Lists
 - End lists with appropriate punctuation.
  - Use tabs.
  - Refrain from long indentation chains.
    - Like so.
      - Please.
        - Do not.
          - Write documents.
            - In this horrible way.
              - I will literallly burn.
 - Feel free to type with tabs, although it should convert to holy double space, ItsBaZ.

### Miscellaneous
General stylistic information that isn’t large enough for its own H3.

#### Acceptable Abbreviations
 - Misc as in miscellaneous, except in any conlang to English translation wherein you would write out the full *miscellaneous*, lest written in the conlang as a [colexification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colexification) abbreviation.
 - Etc as in et cetera, same clause as misc, but writing out the full *et cetera*.
 - E.g. as in for example, same clause as misc, but writing out the full *for example*.
 - I.e. as in that is, same clause as misc, but writing out the full *that is*.
 - Alh as Alhvynkaris, *only* after possible semantic satiation or if it must be written frequently.
 - Aev as Aevelas, same clause as Alh.
 - Conlang as constructed language.

#### Common Practices
[Markdown link](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#External+links) words that you may consider to be rarely used to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. If the word is more of a term or unavailable on the aforementioned dictionary, link it to the appropriate Wikipedia article like how colexification was linked above. If both the Merriam-Webster dictionary *and* Wikipedia is unavailable, you may not be using a real word. If this unreal word is actually a word in any conlang or an Alhvynkaris specific term, markdown link to its most appropriate document.

The hierarchy of priority from greatest to least for conlang word linking is;
 - Exact word.
 - Phrase the ([fossil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_word#:~:text=A%20fossil%20word%20is%20a,'%20in%20'much%20ado'.)) word is used in.
 - Exact dialect of its conlang.
 - Exact conlang.
 - [[Conlang Index|Conlang index]].

Links, whether [internal](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#Internal+links) or [external](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax#External+links), should not spill over in the parenthesis they may be in.

When in need of a placeholder or example link, link to [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) out of cortesy for Obsidian being the foundation of this project.

Feel free to bold, italicize, and/or underline words when attention and tension is intended to be brought to them. Do not however, overuse it. Use apostrophes for both bold and italic, and underscores for underlining.

### Trivia Section
 - If some additional information is short, unnecessary, *and* doesn't fit into a comment into the text as a footnote, you may put it down in a trivia section, as a list. There must be a line break between the trivia section and the section above it.

[^1] Use complicated words to *condense* information, i.e., to get to the point quicker. Do **not** use complicated words to add to your word count. Ensure your reader is capable of searching up the definition of words, so keep to common American English dictionaries.
[^2] Although the temptation of using § and ¶ is inescapable, we must refrain from the lawyer writing lands until we are writing laws for our nations. Review § 1, ¶ 1, footnote 2 as to why that is.
