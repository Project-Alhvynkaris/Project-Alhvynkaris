hello!

I used to be normal in 2023. A year later, I got into Arch Linux, and I'm now extraordinarily nerdy and pedantic. 100.00% sure.

you can tell because i use arch, btw.

I started Project Alhvynkaris because the name was cool. It was originally 'Aelrithna', but I find Aelrithnia to be a better name.

I wrote Ael's magic system to be powerful and fancy. And so that my isekai'd mages can still somewhat use magic in other worlds.

I do and learn things in pursuit of advancing Ael, and am eyeing Nix and its Linux distribution...

I apologize
